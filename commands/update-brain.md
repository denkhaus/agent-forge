# Update Brain

Continuous learning and knowledge refinement.

## Purpose
- Store new learnings and development insights
- Recognize and document universal development principles
- Structure knowledge for optimal organization and retrieval
- Map relationships between related concepts and patterns

## When to Use
- After completing development tasks
- When discovering new patterns or insights
- Following problem-solving sessions
- During code reviews and refactoring
- After learning new techniques or approaches

## What It Does
1. **Pattern Recognition** - Identifies and stores universal development principles
2. **Knowledge Structure** - Splits large learnings into organized, focused memories
3. **Relationship Mapping** - Maintains connections between related concepts
4. **Metadata Management** - Includes sources, references, and context
5. **Continuous Learning** - Builds comprehensive knowledge base over time

## Knowledge Organization Strategy

### Pattern Recognition
- Identify reusable development patterns
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Capture problem-solving approaches
- Store debugging techniques and solutions

### Knowledge Structure
- Split large learnings into focused, digestible memories
- Group related concepts logically
- Create hierarchical knowledge organization
- Maintain clear topic categorization

### Relationship Mapping
- Connect related memories and concepts
- Build knowledge graphs for complex topics
- Link cause-and-effect relationships
- Map dependencies between components

### Metadata Management
- Include URLs, documentation links, and references
- Use enumerated keys to avoid overriding existing metadata:
  - `github-url-1`, `github-url-2`
  - `source-1`, `source-2`
  - `reference-1`, `reference-2`
- Add context about when and why knowledge was captured
- Include difficulty levels and complexity indicators

## Process Flow
1. **Capture Learning** - Document new insights and patterns
2. **Organize Knowledge** - Structure information logically
3. **Create Relationships** - Link to related existing knowledge
4. **Add Metadata** - Include sources and context
5. **Follow with Compaction** - Optimize storage after updates

## Expected Outcome
- Comprehensive knowledge base of development insights
- Well-organized, searchable memory structure
- Connected knowledge graph with clear relationships
- Rich metadata for context and reference
- Continuous improvement of development practices

## Usage
Request "update brain" and the system will:
- Analyze recent development activities
- Extract key learnings and patterns
- Structure knowledge into organized memories
- Create relationships with existing knowledge
- Add comprehensive metadata and references
- Suggest brain compaction if needed
