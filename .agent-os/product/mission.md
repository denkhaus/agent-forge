## Pitch

AgentForge is a Git-native AI agent development platform that helps developers build, share, and manage AI agent components by providing a collaborative ecosystem with local-first development and 30-second component sharing.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Developers**: Building and sharing AI components for personal projects
- **Open Source Community**: Contributing to the AI agent ecosystem through GitHub
- **Early Adopters**: Developers wanting Git-native AI workflows and rapid iteration

### User Personas

**AI Developer** (25-40 years old)
- **Role:** Software Engineer, AI Researcher, Indie Developer
- **Context:** Building AI applications and needing reusable components
- **Pain Points:** Component discovery friction, complex sharing workflows, vendor lock-in
- **Goals:** Rapid prototyping, community collaboration, maintainable AI systems

**Open Source Contributor** (20-35 years old)
- **Role:** Developer, Maintainer, Community Builder
- **Context:** Contributing to AI tooling and building reputation
- **Pain Points:** High barrier to sharing, limited discoverability, fragmented ecosystems
- **Goals:** Easy contribution, community recognition, standardized workflows

## The Problem

### Component Sharing Friction

Current AI development requires rebuilding common components from scratch or dealing with complex integration processes. This results in 80% of development time spent on boilerplate rather than innovation.

**Our Solution:** Git-native component sharing with 30-second publish workflow.

### Ecosystem Fragmentation

AI tools and prompts are scattered across different platforms with incompatible formats. This creates vendor lock-in and limits reusability across projects.

**Our Solution:** Standardized component format with GitHub-based distribution.

### Local Development Complexity

Setting up AI agent development environments requires complex toolchain management and cloud dependencies. This slows iteration and increases costs.

**Our Solution:** Local-first architecture with beautiful CLI and TUI interfaces.

## Differentiators

### Git-Native Distribution

Unlike centralized AI marketplaces, we leverage GitHub's existing infrastructure and workflows. This results in zero vendor lock-in and familiar developer experience.

### Local-First Architecture

Unlike cloud-dependent platforms, we provide fast local iteration with SQLite storage and offline capabilities. This results in sub-second response times and reduced operational costs.

### Three-Component Ecosystem

Unlike monolithic AI frameworks, we provide modular Tools, Prompts, and Agents that compose cleanly. This results in better maintainability and reusability.

## Key Features
