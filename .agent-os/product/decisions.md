## 2025-01-23: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

AgentForge will be a Git-native AI agent development platform focused on component sharing through GitHub, targeting individual developers and the open source community with local-first architecture and 30-second sharing workflows.

### Context

The AI development ecosystem lacks standardized component sharing mechanisms. Developers repeatedly rebuild common tools, prompts, and agent configurations. Existing platforms create vendor lock-in and require complex cloud dependencies. There's an opportunity to leverage Git's proven distribution model for AI components.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Centralized Marketplace Platform**
   - Pros: Easier discovery, centralized quality control, monetization potential
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, single point of failure, hosting costs, slower iteration

2. **Cloud-First Architecture**
   - Pros: Scalability, collaboration features, managed infrastructure
   - Cons: Network dependency, higher costs, slower development cycles

3. **Plugin System for Existing Tools**
   - Pros: Leverage existing user base, faster adoption
   - Cons: Limited by host platform, fragmented experience

### Rationale

Key factors in decision:
- **Developer Familiarity**: Git workflows are already understood by target users
- **Zero Vendor Lock-in**: Components remain accessible even if platform disappears
- **Local-First Performance**: Sub-second response times for development workflows
- **Community Leverage**: GitHub's existing social features (stars, forks, issues)
- **Proven Distribution**: Git has successfully distributed code for decades

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Familiar workflows reduce adoption friction
- No hosting costs for component distribution
- Natural versioning and branching support
- Existing GitHub community and discoverability
- Offline development capability

**Negative:**
- Limited centralized quality control
- Dependency on GitHub's availability and policies
- More complex discovery compared to centralized search
- Potential fragmentation across repositories

## 2025-01-23: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Go 1.24.0 with SQLite/Ent ORM, Bubble Tea TUI, and samber/do dependency injection for local-first architecture with beautiful developer experience.

### Context

Need technology stack that supports:
- Fast local development and iteration
- Beautiful terminal interfaces for developer tools
- Type-safe database operations
- Clean, testable architecture
- Cross-platform distribution

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Rust + SQLite**
   - Pros: Performance, memory safety, growing ecosystem
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve, smaller talent pool, longer compile times

2. **TypeScript + Node.js**
   - Pros: Large ecosystem, familiar to many developers, rapid development
   - Cons: Runtime overhead, dependency management complexity, less suitable for CLI tools

3. **Python + FastAPI**
   - Pros: AI ecosystem familiarity, rapid prototyping, extensive libraries
   - Cons: Distribution complexity, performance limitations, dependency management

### Rationale

Go provides optimal balance of:
- **Performance**: Compiled binary with fast startup times
- **Developer Experience**: Strong tooling, clear error messages, fast compilation
- **Distribution**: Single binary deployment across platforms
- **Ecosystem**: Excellent CLI/TUI libraries (Bubble Tea, Cobra)
- **Database**: Type-safe ORM with code generation (Ent)
- **Architecture**: Built-in interfaces and dependency injection support

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast, reliable CLI tool performance
- Beautiful terminal interfaces with Bubble Tea
- Type-safe database operations with Ent
- Clean architecture with dependency injection
- Easy cross-platform distribution

**Negative:**
- Smaller AI/ML ecosystem compared to Python
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Go
- Less dynamic than interpreted languages for rapid prototyping

## 2025-01-23: Local-First Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement local-first architecture with SQLite storage, Git-based synchronization, and optional cloud features rather than cloud-first approach.

### Context

Developer tools need to be fast, reliable, and work offline. Cloud dependencies create friction in development workflows and introduce failure points. However, collaboration features require some cloud integration.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Cloud-First with Local Cache**
   - Pros: Easier collaboration, centralized features, consistent experience
   - Cons: Network dependency, slower iteration, higher operational costs

2. **Hybrid Architecture**
   - Pros: Best of both worlds, gradual migration path
   - Cons: Complexity, potential consistency issues, dual maintenance

### Rationale

Local-first provides:
- **Speed**: Sub-second response times for all operations
- **Reliability**: Works without network connectivity
- **Privacy**: Sensitive data stays local by default
- **Cost**: No cloud infrastructure costs for core functionality
- **Git Integration**: Natural fit with Git-based distribution

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Excellent developer experience with fast operations
- No cloud dependencies for core functionality
- Natural backup through Git repositories
- Lower operational costs and complexity

**Negative:**
- Collaboration features require additional complexity
- Synchronization challenges across devices
- Limited real-time features without cloud components
