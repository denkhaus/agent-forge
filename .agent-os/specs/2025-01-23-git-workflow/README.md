# Sophisticated Git Development Workflow Specification

> **Created:** 2025-01-23  
> **Status:** Planning  
> **Priority:** High  
> **Roadmap Reference:** Phase 1 - MVP Foundation  

## Overview

Establish a sophisticated, controlled Git-based development workflow that emphasizes feature branches, step-by-step development, and automated quality gates to replace the current direct-to-main development approach.

## Context

### Current Workflow Analysis

**‚úÖ Current Strengths (from DEV_WORKFLOW.md):**
- Clear "commit often when builds work" principle
- Git-based recovery strategy with restore commands
- Build validation before commits (`make build`)
- Structured commit messages with status indicators
- Recovery procedures for corrupted files

**‚ùå Current Limitations:**
- All development happens directly on `main` branch
- No feature isolation or parallel development support
- No automated quality gates or CI integration
- No code review process or collaboration workflow
- No release management or versioning strategy
- Risk of main branch instability during development

**üîç Git History Analysis:**
- Recent commits show direct main branch development
- Good commit message patterns with feature descriptions
- Build status tracking in commit messages
- No evidence of feature branch usage

### Problem Statement

The current workflow, while functional for solo development, lacks the sophistication needed for:
1. **Parallel Feature Development** - Multiple features in progress simultaneously
2. **Quality Assurance** - Automated testing and validation before integration
3. **Collaboration Readiness** - Code review and team development support
4. **Release Management** - Controlled releases with proper versioning
5. **Risk Mitigation** - Isolated development preventing main branch corruption

## Specification

### Git Workflow Strategy

#### Branch Structure

```
main (protected)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (integration branch)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/tui-prompt-workbench
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/component-discovery
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/github-integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/critical-bug-fix
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release/v0.2.0
```

#### Branch Types and Purposes

**1. Main Branch (`main`)**
- **Purpose:** Production-ready code only
- **Protection:** Protected branch with required status checks
- **Merge Policy:** Only from `release/*` and `hotfix/*` branches
- **Auto-deployment:** Triggers release builds and tagging

**2. Develop Branch (`develop`)**
- **Purpose:** Integration branch for feature development
- **Source:** Branched from `main`
- **Merge Policy:** Feature branches merge here first
- **Validation:** Continuous integration and automated testing

**3. Feature Branches (`feature/*`)**
- **Naming:** `feature/brief-description` (e.g., `feature/tui-prompt-workbench`)
- **Source:** Branched from `develop`
- **Lifecycle:** Created ‚Üí Developed ‚Üí Tested ‚Üí Reviewed ‚Üí Merged
- **Scope:** Single feature or closely related functionality

**4. Release Branches (`release/*`)**
- **Naming:** `release/v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` (e.g., `release/v0.2.0`)
- **Source:** Branched from `develop` when feature-complete
- **Purpose:** Release preparation, bug fixes, documentation
- **Merge:** Into both `main` and `develop`

**5. Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)**
- **Naming:** `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
- **Source:** Branched from `main` for critical production fixes
- **Urgency:** Fast-track process for critical issues
- **Merge:** Into both `main` and `develop`

### Development Workflow

#### Feature Development Process

```bash
# 1. Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/tui-prompt-workbench

# 2. Development cycle (enhanced from current workflow)
# Make changes
make build                    # Validate build
make test                     # Run tests
make lint                     # Code quality checks
git add .
git commit -m "feat(tui): implement prompt editor tab

- Add rich text editing with syntax highlighting
- Implement live preview with variable substitution
- Add template support for common patterns

BUILD: ‚úÖ | TESTS: ‚úÖ | LINT: ‚úÖ"

# 3. Regular sync with develop
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop     # Keep history clean

# 4. Push feature branch
git push origin feature/tui-prompt-workbench

# 5. Create Pull Request when ready
# ‚Üí Automated CI/CD pipeline runs
# ‚Üí Code review process
# ‚Üí Merge to develop after approval
```

#### Release Process

```bash
# 1. Create release branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v0.2.0

# 2. Release preparation
# - Update version numbers
# - Update CHANGELOG.md
# - Final testing and bug fixes
# - Documentation updates

# 3. Release commits
git commit -m "chore(release): prepare v0.2.0

- Update version to 0.2.0
- Update CHANGELOG with new features
- Final documentation review

BUILD: ‚úÖ | TESTS: ‚úÖ | DOCS: ‚úÖ"

# 4. Merge to main (via PR)
# ‚Üí Creates GitHub release
# ‚Üí Tags version
# ‚Üí Triggers deployment

# 5. Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge release/v0.2.0
git push origin develop
```

### Enhanced Commit Standards

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Example:**
```
feat(tui): implement AI-powered prompt optimization

- Add PromptOptimizer interface with gap analysis
- Implement iterative enhancement with feedback loops
- Add convergence detection to prevent infinite loops
- Create optimization history tracking

Closes #123
Relates to Phase 1 MVP development

BUILD: ‚úÖ | TESTS: ‚úÖ | LINT: ‚úÖ | COVERAGE: 85%
```
