## Migration Strategy

### Current State Preservation
```bash
# Before starting migration
git checkout main
git tag pre-workflow-migration
git push origin pre-workflow-migration
```

### Step-by-Step Migration
1. **Backup current state** with git tag
2. **Create develop branch** from main
3. **Set up protection rules** gradually
4. **Test workflow** with small changes first
5. **Migrate existing work** to feature branches
6. **Enable full protection** after validation

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# If migration fails, rollback to previous state
git checkout main
git reset --hard pre-workflow-migration
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

#### Branch Protection Lockout
**Risk:** Overly restrictive protection rules prevent legitimate work
**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Start with minimal protection and gradually increase
- [ ] Maintain admin override capability
- [ ] Test protection rules with non-critical branches first
- [ ] Document emergency procedures

#### CI/CD Pipeline Failures
**Risk:** Broken CI prevents all development
**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Implement gradual rollout of new CI features
- [ ] Maintain fallback to manual validation
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for CI health
- [ ] Create bypass procedures for critical fixes

#### Developer Adoption Resistance
**Risk:** Team doesn't adopt new workflow
**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Provide comprehensive training and documentation
- [ ] Start with voluntary adoption period
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate on workflow
- [ ] Demonstrate clear benefits and improvements

### Medium-Risk Items

#### Merge Conflict Complexity
**Risk:** Feature branch merges become complex
**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Encourage frequent rebasing with develop
- [ ] Provide merge conflict resolution training
- [ ] Create automated conflict detection
- [ ] Implement merge queue for complex changes

#### Performance Impact
**Risk:** CI/CD overhead slows development
**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Optimize CI pipeline performance
- [ ] Implement parallel job execution
- [ ] Cache dependencies and build artifacts
- [ ] Monitor and optimize pipeline duration
