# MVP Vision and Goals

## MVP Project Vision

**AgentForge MVP transforms the existing MCP Planner into a delightful Git-native component sharing system where developers can easily discover, share, and manage AI agent components through GitHub.**

We focus on making component sharing take 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes by:
- Building on the solid MCP Planner foundation
- Using GitHub as our component marketplace
- Creating beautiful, fast CLI experiences
- Optimizing for individual developer delight

## MVP Core Philosophy

### 1. GitHub-Native Development
- **GitHub as marketplace**: Leverage existing developer workflows
- **Simple versioning**: Basic Git tags and releases
- **Community discovery**: Use GitHub stars and search
- **No custom infrastructure**: Build on proven platforms

### 2. Simple Component Management
- **Three types only**: Tools, Prompts, and Agents
- **Basic validation**: YAML schema validation
- **Local storage**: PostgreSQL for fast operations
- **Easy sharing**: One command to push/pull components

### 3. Developer Delight First
- **Beautiful TUI**: Interactive interfaces with bubbletea
- **Fast operations**: <1s CLI response times
- **Clear feedback**: Helpful error messages with hints
- **Intuitive workflow**: Minimal learning curve

### 4. Local-First Development
- **Offline capable**: Work without internet after initial setup
- **Fast iteration**: Local PostgreSQL for speed
- **Simple sync**: Basic push/pull with GitHub
- **MCP integration**: Preserve existing MCP server discovery

## MVP Strategic Goals

### MVP Goals (6 weeks)
1. **Foundation**: Rename MCP Planner to Forge, basic CLI structure
2. **GitHub Integration**: Component discovery and sharing via GitHub API
3. **Component Management**: Create, list, pull, push Tools/Prompts/Agents
4. **Developer Experience**: Beautiful TUI with bubbletea, <5min first success

### Post-MVP Goals (3-6 months)
1. **Community Growth**: 50+ components by month 3, 100+ developers by month 6
2. **Enhanced Discovery**: Better filtering, component quality indicators
3. **Local Development**: Hot reloading, testing framework
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides, video tutorials

### Future Vision (6+ months) - POSTPONED
1. **Advanced Features**: Complex dependency resolution, security sandboxing
2. **Enterprise Features**: Team collaboration, deployment management
3. **Custom Marketplace**: Move beyond GitHub if needed
4. **AI-Powered Features**: Intelligent composition suggestions
