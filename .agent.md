## Agent Memory Configuration

### Project ID Location

The memory MCP project ID is stored in the `.project` file in the root directory. This file contains a single UUID that identifies the memory project for this workspace.

**Current Project ID**: Read from `.project` file
**Format**: UUID (e.g., `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### Project Initialization

If no `.project` file exists, you **MUST** create a new project:

1. Call `create_project` to generate a new project
2. Save the returned project_id to `.project` file
3. Use this project_id for all subsequent memory operations

### Memory System Quick Reference

- **Memory Fields**: title (required), topics (required), content (required), metadata (optional)
- **Search Threshold**: 0.6 default (0.5-0.6 broad, 0.7-0.8 precise, 0.8+ strict)
- **Vector Model**: nomic-embed-text (768 dimensions)

## Product Knowledge

**All product information is documented in `.agent-os/product/`:**

- Mission & vision: `.agent-os/product/mission.md`
- Development roadmap: `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
- Technology stack: `.agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`
- Architecture decisions: `.agent-os/product/decisions.md`
- Code style guide: `.agent-os/product/code-style.md`
- Development practices: `.agent-os/product/dev-best-practices.md`

## Agent OS Commands

**All commands are detailed in the `./commands/` directory:**

### Brain Management Commands

Offer these to users after task completion, context pruning, or clearing:

- `load-brain.md` - Load project context and development rules
- `compact-brain.md` - Optimize memory storage while preserving knowledge
- `update-brain.md` - Continuous learning and knowledge refinement

### Product Development Commands

- `analyze-product.md` - Analyze codebase and install Agent OS
- `plan-product.md` - Plan new product and install Agent OS
- `create-spec.md` - Create detailed feature specifications
- `execute-tasks.md` - Execute development tasks systematically

### Command Usage Guidelines

Offer users these commands when:

1. **After task completion** - `update-brain.md`, `compact-brain.md`
2. **Context was `/pruned` or `/cleared`** - `load-brain.md`
3. **Starting new features** - `create-spec.md`
4. **Beginning development** - `execute-tasks.md`

## Development Standards (Quick Reference)

### Core Principles

- **Dependency Injection**: Use `samber/do` with interface-based design
- **File Size Limit**: 500 lines maximum (refactor at 400+ lines)
- **Options Pattern**: Use `options.WithHost(host string)` when appropriate
- **Backup Before Refactoring**: Always backup files before structural changes

### Workspace Guidelines

- Keep codebase free from build artifacts
- Build in `/tmp/forge-build` when possible
- Backup files before using `sed` command
- Follow TDD approach with comprehensive testing

**For complete standards, see `.agent-os/product/code-style.md` and `.agent-os/product/dev-best-practices.md`**
